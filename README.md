### Hello! I'm Jeffrey ðŸ‘‹

Software Engineer at Tastebean. I work mostly with Ruby on Rails and Vue.

My rule of thumb for software engineering:
- Convention over configuration!
- Abstract complexity responsibly!

Some other tools/stacks that I'd love to work more with:
- Elixir/Phoenix
- Crystal lang
- Ionic/Capacitor
- Flutter
